# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdullah

I'm a Ruby on Rails developer who likes helping people learn. I run [Guided Rails](https://guidedrails.com), an organization for mentoring new and aspiring Rails developers.

I'm also a contributor to [Stocks in the Future](https://github.com/rubyforgood/stocks-in-the-future), a Ruby for Good project that supports financial literacy for students.

If you have questions about Rails, want some advice, or just want to talk about programming, feel free to email me: **abdul@hey.com**

I'm always open to pairing. If you want to pair on something, just ask.

I play the banjo (badly). If you ever need to hear a terrible version of “Old Joe Clark,” I’m your man.
